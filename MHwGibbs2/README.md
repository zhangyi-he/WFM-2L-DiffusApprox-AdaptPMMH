# A Bayesian approach for estimating selection coefficients (nonconstant over time) from aDNA data.

PolynomialCurve includes the source code implemented for the case that the selection coefficient changes over time by following a polynomial curve.

SigmoidCurve includes the source code implemented for the case the case that the selection coefficient changes over time by following a sigmoid curve.
