# Estimating temporally variable selection intensity from ancient DNA data with the flexibility of modelling linkage and epistasis
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring temporally variable selection from ancient DNA data (in format of genotype likelihoods) with the flexibility of modelling linkage and epistasis, and the preprint has been submitted to Molecular Biology and Evolution available at

[Code v1.0](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-2L-DiffusApprox-AdaptPMMH/tree/master/Code%20v1.0) includes the source code implemented for horse base coat colours (ASIP and MC1R with epistasis) and horse pinto coat patterns (KIT13 and KIT16 with linkage), where the linkage disequilibrium is fixed to be 0 for horse base coat colours and the selection coefficient of mixed against solid is fixed to be -1 for horse pinto coat patterns.
